On Public Demo Day we finally closed the loop and got our camera integrated into our project. We used OpenCV with an API to achieve smile detection with our camera, that wrote whether or not a smile was detected to a .txt in our Final Project folder. We were then able to check in our c code whether a smile had been detected or not and use that information to determine the image that was displayed on our screen. If a smile was detected our screen would display a smile(pictured left), and if not it would display a frown(pictured right). With that we had finally reached our reach goal of integrating the camera in an interactive way into our system!

For the class demo we were able to finally get our project working. Able to successfully display configured patterns and designs on our wodden tile screen. We were also able to take photos with our camera, but hadn't integrated it into the program.
